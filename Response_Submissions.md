Step 1: Verify Backend Grading System

  1. Database Check: Yes the submissions table has my recent submission, and past submissions       
  2. Edge Function Logs: Check Supabase Edge Function logs has "no results", and the Invocations also has "No Results", additionally, the "Logs & Analytics"  for edge functions as whole logs.. is there something wrong here in a major way? Like I feel like we maybe have forgoten to active a feature of supabase.. 
  3. Trigger Verification: Ensure the database trigger is firing when submissions are created - For this I'm not sure what you're talking about, is there something I need to turn on or give permissions too?

  Step 2: Add Real-time Status Tracking

  What needs to be added:
  1. Submission Status Subscriptions: Real-time updates as status changes from pending ‚Üí grading ‚Üí passed/failed
  2. UI Status Indicators: Calendar/sidebar should show submission status       
  3. Modal Notifications: Automatic popups when grading completes

  Step 3: Enhanced UX Flow

  What the user should see:
  1. Immediate: "‚úÖ Submission received - grading in progress"
  2. Calendar Updates: Checkpoints show "üìù SUBMITTED - GRADING" status
  3. Real-time: When grading completes ‚Üí Modal popup with pass/fail + feedback  
  4. Failed Submissions: Clear resubmission options + witness override path

   IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

  Phase A: Backend Verification

  - Check if submissions are actually being created in database
  - Verify gradeSubmission Edge Function is triggering
  - Check Edge Function logs for errors/API failures

  Phase B: Real-time Status System

  - Add Supabase subscriptions to monitor submission status changes
  - Update calendar/sidebar to show submission status visually
  - Add status badges: "SUBMITTED", "GRADING", "PASSED", "FAILED"

  Phase C: Notification & Feedback System

  - Modal popup when grading completes (pass/fail)
  - Failed submission guidance with resubmission + witness options
  - Success celebrations for passed submissions

  Phase D: Backend Monitoring Tools

  - Add admin/debug page to see all submissions and their grading status
  - Edge Function monitoring dashboard
  - Grading system health checks

  ü§î QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

## **I think we need to add a rule that makes the submissions 

  1. What did you submit? (file, URL, text) - so I can check the database for that specific submission - I submited a file(picuture)
  2. Priority? Should we start with Phase A (verify grading works) or Phase B (add status indicators)?
  3. Grading expectations? How long should grading typically take (seconds, minutes)?

  I recommend starting with Phase A (backend verification) to see if the grading system is actually working behind the scenes, then adding the UI feedback systems.
