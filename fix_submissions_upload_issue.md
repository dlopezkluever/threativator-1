For the problem described:

"I can't seem to upload anything for the submitting proof, like when I   
  click on a checkpoint or deadline, and I go through the submit proof modal, when it comes the page    
  where you are to upload documented proof (images or files), the file uploaded doesn't save after      
  pressing submit. This is a major problem. here is the submission table rows of our backend 
  "submissions" so you can get a view of what the data structure is for submissions 'c:/Users/Daniel    
  Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Threativator/threativator-1/submissions_rows.sql'  ... Before you edit      
  code, analyze the problem and our codebase to try and see if you can find what the issue could        
  possibly be, like give me your hypothesises for what the issues could be, and then give me a plan of  
   how we can go about trying to fix it in an attempt by attempt manner until we get it right"

We have made the following analysis and battle plan for solving the issue:

 Analysis Complete - Here are the potential issues I've identified:

  1. PRIMARY ISSUE: File Upload Flow Logic Problem

  In FileUploadZone.tsx (lines 177-182), the modal automatically advances to preview when file
  upload succeeds:
  const handleFileSelected = (fileData: FileData) => {
    setSubmissionData(prev => ({ ...prev, fileData }))
    if (fileData.uploadResult?.success) {
      setCurrentStep('preview')  // ❌ BYPASSES INPUT STEP ENTIRELY
    }
  }

  This means users never see the "input" step for file uploads, so there's no way to proceed to
  preview manually.

  2. STORAGE BUCKET ISSUE

  The code references a submissions storage bucket that may not exist:
  // In submissionStorage.ts line 30-35
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('submissions')  // ❌ This bucket might not exist
    .upload(filePath, file, {
      cacheControl: '3600',
      upsert: false
    })

  3. MODAL FLOW INCONSISTENCY

  The modal has different behavior for file uploads vs other types:
  - File uploads: type_selection → input → upload happens → jump to preview
  - Other types: type_selection → input → manually click → preview

  4. ERROR HANDLING GAPS

  File upload errors aren't properly propagated to the modal UI for user feedback.

  Fix Plan - Systematic Approach:

  Attempt 1: Fix Storage Bucket Issue

  1. Check if submissions storage bucket exists in Supabase
  2. Create it if missing with proper policies
  3. Test file upload to ensure it works

  Attempt 2: Fix Modal Flow Logic

  1. Remove automatic step advancement from handleFileSelected
  2. Add manual "CONTINUE" button for file upload step
  3. Ensure consistent flow across all submission types

  Attempt 3: Improve Error Handling

  1. Add proper error display in FileUploadZone
  2. Ensure upload errors are shown to user
  3. Add retry mechanism for failed uploads

  Attempt 4: Database Validation

  1. Verify submissions table constraints
  2. Test database insertion with proper data
  3. Check RLS policies for submissions table
