## **frontend_improvements_to-tie_with_backend_grading_pipeline.md Releated:**

## Starting:
 Okay we recently made corrections to our backend grading pipeline, but we currently have the probelm that the UI / user expereice actually has no idea what happens after they submit something for a checkpoint or deadline when using our calander in the         
  dashboard, and we want to improve it so  users get real-time visibility into this working system through status indicators, result notifications, and resubmission flows.

     The documentation here: 'c:/Users/Daniel Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Threativator/threativator-1/frontend_improvements_to-tie_with_backend_grading_pipeline.md',  provides everything needed to implement, BUT NOTE THEY ARE SUGGESTIONS; you MUST CHECK THAT THE  
   RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CORRECT cuase they made hastily, and thus aren't extremely reliable:
    1. Real-time status badges on calendar/sidebar
    2. Pass/fail notification modals
    3. Resubmission flows for failed attempts
    4. Submission history viewing

  Additionally we made changes to to our calander system cuz our old was having problems, You can read about that here: 'c:/Users/Daniel Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Threativator/threativator-1/NewCalendarSystemDescription.md' ... Let's first start with the        
  pass/fail notification modals. and then make sure to test it and I will then test it myself to make sure it was done right, before we move forward.
