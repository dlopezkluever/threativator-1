## **frontend_improvements_to-tie_with_backend_grading_pipeline.md Releated:**

## Starting:
 Okay we recently made corrections to our backend grading pipeline, but we currently have the probelm that the UI / user expereice actually has no idea what happens after they submit something for a checkpoint or deadline when using our calander in the         
  dashboard, and we want to improve it so  users get real-time visibility into this working system through status indicators, result notifications, and resubmission flows.

     The documentation here: 'c:/Users/Daniel Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Threativator/threativator-1/frontend_improvements_to-tie_with_backend_grading_pipeline.md',  provides everything needed to implement, BUT NOTE THEY ARE SUGGESTIONS; you MUST CHECK THAT THE  
   RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CORRECT cuase they made hastily, and thus aren't extremely reliable:
    1. Real-time status badges on calendar/sidebar
    2. Pass/fail notification modals
    3. Resubmission flows for failed attempts
    4. Submission history viewing

  Additionally we made changes to to our calander system cuz our old was having problems, You can read about that here: 'c:/Users/Daniel Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Threativator/threativator-1/NewCalendarSystemDescription.md' ... Let's first start with the        
  pass/fail notification modals. and then make sure to test it and I will then test it myself to make sure it was done right, before we move forward.

Okay now using the format of I want you to create live semi realistic 3D pixary art of a bunch of animals forming out planet that is magically manifesting life
like it's described in greek mythology (Earth spontaneously created other diverse forms of animal life. After the remaining moisture had warmed in the sun’s fire, the wet mud of the marshlands swelled with heat, and the fertile seeds of things, nourished by life-giving soil as if in a mother’s womb, grew, and in time acquired a nature. So, when the seven-mouthed Nile [p. 589] retreats from the drowned fields and returns to its former bed, and the fresh mud boils in the sun, farmers find many creatures as they turn the lumps of earth. Amongst them they see some just spawned, on the edge of life, some with incomplete bodies and number of limbs, and often in the same matter one part is alive and the other is raw earth. In fact when heat and moisture are mixed they conceive, and from these two things the whole of life originates. And though fire and water fight each other, heat and moisture create everything, and this discordant union is suitable for growth. So when the earth muddied from the recent flood glowed again heated by the deep heaven-sent light of the sun she produced innumerable species, partly remaking previous forms, partly creating new monsters.)
