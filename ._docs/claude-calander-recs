Looking at your calendar interface, I can see it has a strong, bold aesthetic with the red theme. Here are some suggestions to improve the UI and user experience:
Color & Visual Hierarchy

Soften the red intensity - The current bright red is quite harsh. Consider using a more muted red (#D32F2F) or introduce a color hierarchy with different shades
Add more visual breathing room - The black borders are very thick and create a cramped feeling. Try thinner borders (1-2px) in a lighter gray
Improve contrast - Some text appears hard to read against the red backgrounds. Ensure sufficient contrast ratios

Typography & Spacing

Increase font sizes - The text in event blocks appears quite small
Add padding - Event blocks need more internal spacing around the text
Improve text truncation - Instead of cutting off text awkwardly, use proper ellipsis (...)
Consistent text alignment - Some elements appear left-aligned while others are centered

Event Display

Color coding - Use different colors for different event types instead of all red
Better event sizing - Events should resize based on content or have a minimum height
Hover states - Add subtle hover effects to show interactivity
Event previews - Show more context on hover (full title, time, description)

Layout Improvements

Rounded corners - Add subtle border-radius (4-8px) to soften the harsh rectangular look
Grid improvements - The calendar grid could use more consistent sizing
Mobile responsiveness - Consider how this will work on smaller screens

Interactive Elements

Button styling - The PREV/TODAY/NEXT and MONTH/WEEK buttons could use more modern styling
Active states - Show which view is currently selected
Loading states - Consider how the calendar appears while loading data
