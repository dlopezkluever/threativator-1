We need to allow for a submission mode to be simply be just getting external "allibies"; as in your submission will be the sending out of 3 emails to "witnesses" to 
confirm , via them anwsering a survey or something, or being directed to make an account (could do 2 second fomr validation with texts using twilio)
but ultimately it would be them having to confirm to the app that you did in fact complete the task, with some for of verification; though we perfer face scan

Additionally we also need the creation of AI false kompromat using nano banana or AI face love letter, curse out letter.
