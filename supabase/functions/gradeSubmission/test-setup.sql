  'This is a comprehensive test document that contains well over five hundred words to demonstrate that the word counting functionality works correctly in the grading system. The document discusses various aspects of task management and accountability systems, including the psychological principles behind negative reinforcement and how financial stakes can motivate completion of difficult tasks. Research has shown that loss aversion is a powerful motivator, where people are more motivated to avoid losses than to achieve equivalent gains. This principle is central to the Threativator application design. The application leverages both monetary consequences and social accountability through the kompromat system to create strong incentives for task completion. Users commit embarrassing content that will be released if they fail to meet their deadlines, creating a powerful deterrent against procrastination. The system also includes checkpoint-based progress tracking to break large goals into manageable milestones. Each checkpoint has its own deadline and requirements, allowing users to maintain momentum throughout their goal pursuit. The AI grading system analyzes submissions against user-defined rubrics to determine pass or fail status. This automated approach scales better than human verification while maintaining consistency in evaluation standards. The grading system includes multiple validation layers including word count verification, URL accessibility checking, and GitHub commit analysis for coding projects. These quantitative measures provide objective assessment criteria that are difficult to game or circumvent.',
