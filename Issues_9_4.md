## what remains of below:

no, it's still not appearing in the month view of the calander; additionally, in the week view, it seems to make its own new row   ││   instead of using the hour view.. Now i acutally don't think we need the hour by nour view of the week view, it's commpletly        ││   unnecesary. Instead lets just make each day have a longer vertically speaking column space, and make the little cards for each     ││   checkpoint or deadline like a larger squares than hey are currently in the cramped state. but the colums should be as large as     ││   how like the month view is long vertically

Help me understand how we can go about fixing the following UI problems with our web app, regarding the dashboard and some pop up modals, as detailed here: First things first, when you have made a goal that has a deadline and checkpoint, it shows up on the calendar, but they seem to be creating their own row of blank entries under that week of dates. As you can see from the image attached, they are appearing on screen, but in a manner that's not what we're going for. We want them to be in the calendar box for their date, taking up a decent portion of that space. It would be nice in general if the monthly caldner view in gernal took more space (as you can see there is alot of open unused space in that area). 

Secondly, when you open the checkpoint or deadline, by clicking it, you can see that the modal gets stuck to the bottom of the page and There's no ability to click submit proof. like You can't see a button to submit anything. We want the pop-up model to actually be, when you click on it on a date, to be just like the pop-up models for the command actions where it takes up the center of the screen, In the middle, and it makes the background blurry, and all you can really see in the center of the screen is the pop-up model. It's quite, it's decently large where you can see all the information, and you can also click a button to submit proof. We cannot do that currently

Additionally, it seems like the checkpoints and deadlines, they're not appearing in the immediate directives sidebar. I did not see them in the sidebar. It should be there present.

As for the command actions, the exit button doesn't fiw. To fix this, let's remove Submit proof from the command actions, as we don't actually need a submit proof button in the command actions. You can remove that and thus allow the exit to fit in the box as the last item of the six boxes. Right now there's seven, and thus the exit button does not fit. That is no good.

When creating a new mission, the UI seems to not really fit. It's much too large, especially if you can see the text boxes for mission designation, mission briefing, final deadline. I mean, all those boxes are much too large, and the overall cards are much too large, taking up and going over the screen limit. 

Oh, yeah, for the kompromat, it would be nice to be able to view the kompromat after you have submited it. Right now, we can only delete it when you're looking at the managing existing tab. It'd be nice if you could delete it. Let's fix these issues.
