# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase Auth with email/password authentication, create login and signup pages with proper form validation, and establish protected routes
# Details:
Create auth context provider using React Context API to manage authentication state. Implement signup page at /signup with email/password fields using controlled components. Add login page at /login with remember me option. Set up protected route wrapper component that redirects to login if user is not authenticated. Use Supabase's signUp() and signIn() methods. Handle auth state changes with onAuthStateChange listener. Store auth tokens securely using Supabase's built-in session management. Create logout functionality that clears session. Add password reset flow using Supabase's resetPasswordForEmail. Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages for common auth errors (invalid credentials, email already exists, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
Test signup with valid/invalid emails and weak/strong passwords. Verify login works with correct credentials and fails with incorrect ones. Ensure protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test password reset email delivery and token validation. Verify session persistence across page refreshes. Test logout clears all auth data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Supabase Auth Context Provider [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build React Context API provider to manage authentication state globally across the application
### Details:
Create AuthContext using React.createContext with TypeScript interfaces for User, Session, and AuthState. Implement AuthProvider component that wraps the app and manages auth state using useState. Initialize Supabase client and set up onAuthStateChange listener in useEffect to track session changes. Expose methods for signIn, signUp, signOut, and resetPassword through context value. Handle loading states during auth initialization. Create useAuth custom hook for consuming auth context in components. Store session in localStorage for persistence across page refreshes. Implement error state management for auth operations.

## 2. Build Signup and Login Pages with Form Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create responsive signup and login pages with comprehensive form validation and error handling
### Details:
Create SignupPage component at /signup route with email, password, and confirm password fields using controlled components. Implement real-time validation for email format, password strength (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number), and password match. Build LoginPage at /login with email/password fields and 'Remember Me' checkbox that controls session persistence. Add loading spinners during auth operations. Display user-friendly error messages for common scenarios: email already registered, invalid credentials, network errors. Style forms using existing project CSS framework or Tailwind. Include links between signup/login pages. Implement auto-redirect to dashboard after successful authentication.

## 3. Implement Protected Route Wrapper Component [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create HOC or wrapper component to protect routes that require authentication
### Details:
Build ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication status from AuthContext. Implement loading state while checking auth status to prevent flashing of protected content. Redirect unauthenticated users to /login with return URL in query params. Store attempted route in sessionStorage to redirect after successful login. Create PublicRoute component that redirects authenticated users away from login/signup pages. Handle edge cases like expired sessions mid-navigation. Implement role-based access control foundation for future admin routes. Add layout wrapper that shows different navigation based on auth status.

## 4. Add Password Reset Flow with Email Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Implement complete password reset functionality using Supabase's built-in email service
### Details:
Create ForgotPasswordPage at /forgot-password with email input form. Implement resetPasswordForEmail() call with proper error handling for non-existent emails. Configure Supabase email templates for password reset in project dashboard. Create ResetPasswordPage at /reset-password that reads token from URL params. Build form for new password entry with confirmation field and strength validation. Handle updateUser() call to save new password. Display success message and auto-redirect to login after password update. Implement rate limiting feedback to prevent abuse. Add password reset link to login page.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create robust error handling system with user-friendly messages and recovery options
### Details:
Create centralized error handler utility that maps Supabase error codes to user-friendly messages. Implement toast notification system for auth feedback (success/error/info). Handle specific scenarios: email not confirmed, rate limiting, network errors, invalid tokens. Add retry logic for transient failures with exponential backoff. Create error boundary for auth components to catch unexpected errors. Implement session refresh logic for expired tokens. Add helpful tooltips for password requirements and form fields. Create loading states with skeleton screens during auth operations. Log errors to console in development, prepare for production error tracking.
