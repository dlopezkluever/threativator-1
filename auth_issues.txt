Most Likely Culprits (in order of probability):

  1. ProtectedRoute + Onboarding Logic Conflict (90% likely)

  - The ProtectedRoute with requiredOnboarding is probably creating an infinite redirect loop
  - User is authenticated but onboarding status check is failing/slow
  - This would explain why incognito works initially but breaks on reload

  2. AuthContext Session Restoration Issues (85% likely)

  - useEffect in AuthContext may not be properly waiting for Supabase session restoration
  - Race condition between session check and component mounting
  - Session might be getting cleared prematurely during the auth state initialization

  3. Supabase Session Persistence Problems (75% likely)

  - Session storage/localStorage issues
  - Supabase client configuration might not be persisting sessions properly
  - Browser security settings or extensions interfering with session storage

  4. Onboarding Status Database Query Bottleneck (60% likely)

  - The onboarding status check in ProtectedRoute might be slow/failing
  - Database connection timeout during the profiles table query
  - Missing user profile record causing the query to hang

  5. Multiple AuthContext Providers or React Strict Mode (40% likely)

  - Double mounting in development mode causing auth state confusion
  - Multiple auth checks running simultaneously

  Quick Diagnostic Questions:

  1. Are you seeing any console errors during the loading screen?
  2. Does the loading screen show any specific message or just blank?
  3. Are you completing the onboarding flow or skipping it somehow?

  Most Efficient Fix Strategy:

  1. First: Add detailed logging to AuthContext to see exactly where it's hanging
  2. Second: Temporarily remove requiredOnboarding from the dashboard route to isolate the issue
  3. Third: Check if onboarding status query is actually completing

  The fact that it works in incognito initially but breaks on reload strongly suggests a session restoration + onboarding check conflict. This is a classic authentication flow issue where the app gets stuck between "user is
  authenticated" and "user needs onboarding."
